sort1 uses: bubble

How do you know?: The pre-sorted list was a lot faster than random = Omega(n)

sort2 uses: merge

How do you know?: The sorting of random files was the fastest of the three = O(n*logn)

sort3 uses: selection

How do you know?: Slightly faster than bubble on large dataset, sorting pre-sorted list takes the same amount of time as random = Theta(n^2)
